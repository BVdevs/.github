## Hi there 👋

My name is **Bernie** and I starded this little project as a hobby to learn how to ✨ _code_ ✨ batch.

I'm currently working🔨 on an app called [MyCMD](https://github.com/BernieDevStudio/MyCMD) an app that lets you do *nearly* everything on your machine💻.

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
